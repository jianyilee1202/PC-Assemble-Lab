# PC-Assemble-Lab
*This is the PC assemble in the lab of technology and information system (SECP1513-09).*

**What I have gained:**  ლ｜＾Д＾ლ｜

I gained hands-on technical skills by learning how to properly install components like CPU, RAM, motherboard, power supply, cooling system and others as well as how to test if the PC was functioning correctly after assembly by connecting a monitor. Furthermore, I worked with other team members to solve unexpected problems, such as misplaced components. 


I learnt about the function and importance of each component:

- **Motherboard:** The foundation of the system.

- **CPU:** The brain of the computer.

- **RAM:** Temporary storage for fast processing.

- **Power Supply Unit (PSU):** Ensures proper power distribution.

- **Cooling Systems:** Keeping the system functional and safe.

**My improvement:** ٩(•ิ˓̭ •ิ )ง

Through the process, I improved my attention to detail. I understood the importance of accurately placing and connecting components. To prevent errors or failures, I recognized the importance of double-checking components and connections.
